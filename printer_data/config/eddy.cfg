# For the mesh dimensions below, the coordinates need to be reachable by the center of the probe. To calculate coordinates that will work, use the formula below:
# mesh x min = position_min_x + greater_of (15mm or x_offset) <--- in this term, only consider the x offset if it is positive, ignore if negative.
# mesh y min = position_min_y + greater_of (15mm or y_offset) <--- in this term, only consider the y offset if it is positive, ignore if negative.
# mesh x max = position_max_x - greater_of (15mm or |x_offset|) <--- in this term, only consider the x offset if it is negative, ignore if positive.
# mesh y max = position_max_y - greater_of (15mm or |y_offset|) <--- in this term, only consider the y offset if it is negative, ignore if positive.
# Example: Consider that you have a 300 x 300 bed with the max x and y positions being 300 and the min being 0. Your probe offsets are -20 for X and 10 for Y
# For mesh x min we ignore the x offset term because it is negative. Therefore mesh x min = 15
# For mesh y min we do not ignore the y offset term because it is positive but it is less than 15 so we use 15. Therefore mesh y min = 15
# For mesh x max we do not ignore the x offset term because it is negative. It is also greater than 15. Therefore mesh x max = 280
# For mesh y max we ignore the y offset term because it is positive but it is less than 15 so we use 15. Therefore mesh y max = 285
# The final result would be mesh_min: 15, 15 mesh_max: 280, 285
mesh_min: 10, 10  # modify these according to the above guide. If the probe cannot reach then you will get a klipper error when trying to scan a bed mesh.
mesh_max: 220, 220 # modify these according to the above guide. If the probe cannot reach then you will get a klipper error when trying to scan a bed mesh.
